[SQUARE]
========

[SQUARE] is a reflex/endurance game where white obstacles have to be avoided and orange bonus yields you points. Beware the bonus that can turn into a malus!

## Build instructions

### Requirements
- Haxe (last version I compiled with is 3.1.3)
- [Sn√µwkit]

In the project's root folder, run in a terminal ```flow build <target>``` with <target> is your wanted target. It's flow based project, so it's compiled the same way as every flow projects.

### Working targets

- Web
- Native (At least Linux. I haven't tried Windows or Mac yet.)

At the moment, saving on Windows or Mac or the Android target are not officially supported as I need to test them on a working environment system.
